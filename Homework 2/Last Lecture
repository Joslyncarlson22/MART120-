I will 100% be straight forward that this lecture was not my cup of tea. However I did pull away some interesting insights.
The speaker created an atmosphere that I couldn't quite follow in the aspect that ideas were flowing fast throughout his lecture.
Even though the main concepts were broken up into three chunks the mix between his personal life and real world concepts caught me distracted often.
I did particularly enjoy the story of his friend whom desired to be filming on a Star Wars film and the speaker essential said really? You've got to be kidding.
Then next thing you know a few years later his child hood dreams had come true. I think the speaker does a good job in reflecting that dreams can come true.
However his highlights on what the outcome is were most intriguing to me. A lot of people don't take the step back to admire what came from that particular situation.
Where I think he highlights well how this is something he does and recommends all do.

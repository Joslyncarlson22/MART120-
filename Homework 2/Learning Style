My learning style was spot on to what I presumed it to be. I have always noticed that my tendencies of learning lean towards being a visual learner and this quiz relatively agreed with that.
As far as structure to the coursework I think this class is set up in a form that suites my learning style. It's very visual based but also offers in depth reading. I also think the beyond open line of communication creates an ease of success feeling.

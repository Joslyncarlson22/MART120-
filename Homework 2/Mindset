From the quiz I learned that I had a growth mindset with some fixed traits. I was slightly surprised by this as I figured I would tend all towards a growth mindset.
I always consider my self the outgoing trial and error of my friend group I always am down to try or learn something new. So it was intriguing to me that part of me holds a fixed mindset.
But in all reality I think we all probably have slight fixed mindset.

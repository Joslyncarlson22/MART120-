Compare and contrast of GUI and Command line:

Both interfaces have pro's/con's in where one might outshine the other. However I think the major difference between the two is user friendly-ness.
GUI tends to be more user-friendly and preferred by most users where as command line is often found used because of its speed and efficiency.

Based off my knowledge of the two interfaces I would lean to agree that I may tend to like GUI better than CLI. I tend to learn and be more productive in a visual-based format rather than a text-based.
However it does seem that CLI may have faster and more innovated functions.

Overall based off my readings it appears both of the interfaces have specific areas they shine. Someone may prefer CLI when they are looking to make something scripted and automated. Whereas if your are looking to simplify the structure of tasks a user may choose GUI.

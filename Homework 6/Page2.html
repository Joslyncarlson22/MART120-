    <h1>The Modern Customer Journey</h1>
    <p>A nightmare most pet owners deal with daily stinky and loose dog feces. Our furry friends bring sparks of joy into the average human’s life. With about 67% of Americans having at least one dog in their household. A few have the luxury of not having to scoop their dog’s feces, but most are either using a shovel, poop scooper, or a small baggie to dispose of their dog’s waste properly. Wouldn’t it be great if the days of cleaning up after your dog were gone? Look no further Poo GoAWAY has your answers.</p>
    <p>How does it work?: It’s simple, just like it should be. After your dog has finished its business, drop a few droplets on top of the matter; roughly 5 minutes later, the waste will dissolve into the ground.</p>
    <p>Why?: This product is invented to promote a more environmentally friendly way to clean up our dogs’ feces. It will eliminate the usage of plastic baggies.</p>
    <p>Who?: Dog owners! Maybe your cat too!</p>
    <p>To best promote the product, poo goAWAY, the company will need to created awareness. Although this is a dog product, it also will promote environmental aspects that will appeal to non-pet owners. Reaching this group through social media ads will be critical. Running ads on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram on the product will help create initial awareness. Social media ads can target dog owners or environmental groups to have two for one of reaching both groups with the same tactic.
      Product placement within pet stores will create awareness for a majority of consumers. Dog owners have been structured towards using ‘poo bags’ and scooping devices. Having Poo GoAWAY as the top display in significant pet stores will gather a good base of consumers. It will allow for consumers to consider a new choice of waste removal. Not everyone goes to pet stores for supplies; another way to reach consumers could be through the ‘old-fashioned’ ways.
      To create essential awareness to pet owners, flyers can be sent throughout apartment complexes to make a starting point towards a vast target audience. This will create awareness within a community that is very pet-oriented and uses the competition, poo-bags, every day. Flyers can also be passed out at busy walking areas and dog parks. This will help reach the biggest group of day-to-day consumers.

      Goal: To make Poo GoAWAY appealing to consumers.</p>
